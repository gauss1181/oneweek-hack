# oneweek-hack
Let's try to come up with and build a simple (but reasonably feasible?) app (maybe with Azure?) in the last 18 hours? :P

New idea: Hack together an improved/sophisticated app similar to Our Story. As in, with the same general idea (collaborative story writing)

However, when words, sentences, or phrases are proposed to be added to a story, they only get added/not added every couple of min when people vote on the best words/phrases/sentences to fill in the next bit of the story. We can also allow people to have the option of choosing to end a story at any point, and also make that a votable option. And when a story ends, archive it in the (azure?) database/cloud, and allow basic NLP algorithms to tag stories by genre :P

^ maybe that implementation wont be fully complete by the video submission deadline at 11:59 pm tonight but at least we can bring it up as a good future feature to consider :)

Let me know what you think. Shall we #hustle and do this? :D
