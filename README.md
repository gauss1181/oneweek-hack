Human trafficking is a serious crime, is a violation of human rights and is prevalent in both developed and developing parts of the world. Trafficking, particularly female trafficking, is a major problem in many parts of America, and is one we want to take a step towards solving. Through our app, we want to create social awareness amongst people about trafficking and also help everyday citizens work with law enforcement to fight human trafficking.

TraffickTips is a web and mobile based app that allows users to tip local law enforcement in dealing with human trafficking through crowdsourcing.

When the user first installs the app, we show them a list “Red Flags” that teaches them how to spot signs of human trafficking. TraffickTips allows users create reports, through either a picture or a manual entry, that they think could be targets of trafficking. Here, users have the option to upload a picture or manually enter a place.

Users can either upload a photo or a sketch. When you click a picture and upload it, our app automatically uses the geolocation from the image to mark the area on Bing Maps. This makes the user experience much more flexible, as they don’t have to worry about explicitly marking areas on the map. Additionally, this improves the safety of our users, as it reduces the risk of them being seen or caught reporting on-site. 

Users can also look at an aggregate view of trafficking tips from other people, which is another great way of social awareness about sketchy activities going on. Law enforcement can use the map to help solve ongoing human trafficking cases. Also, through our app users can look at any particular real-time announcements made by their local police announcement.

We believe our app can make a lot of impact, in terms of both social awareness about trafficking, and also to combat human trafficking altogether.
