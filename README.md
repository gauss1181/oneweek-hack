Human trafficking is a horrible crime and is still prevalent in many developed and developing parts of the world. Trafficking, particularly female trafficking is a major problem in many parts of America, and one we want to take a step towards solving. Through our app, we want to create social awareness amongst people about trafficking and also help fight human trafficking.

Traffick tips is a web and mobile based app that can provide helpful tips to deal with human trafficking. Traffick tips through crowdsourcing, allows users to mark areas (through either a picture or a manual entry) that they think could be targets of trafficking. Users can also look at an aggregate view of trafficking tips from other people, which is another great way of social awareness about sketchy activities going on.

We believe our app can make a lot of impact, in terms of both social awareness about trafficking, and also to combat human trafficking altogether.
